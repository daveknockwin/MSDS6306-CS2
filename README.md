## World Development Indicators

### Introduction

Our world is becoming less poor and more healthy with every year. This is encouraging news, but we must also study potential causes for and hindrances to this phenomenon. 

### Data

We found our data on the world bank website at: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN. The reason we chose this data is because it included Education, Occupation and Gender. In the csv file titled “API_17_DS2_en_csv_v2_10226244.csv”, found in our data directory, we have data collected in all countries of the world between 1960 and 2016. There are 162 indicator variables for which data was collected, but data was not available for every indicator variable. 

For the purposes of our model, we will be looking at the following variables more closely: 

•	Survival to age 65, male (% of cohort)

•	Literacy rate, youth male (% of males ages 15-24)

•	Life Expectancy of Females

•	Percent of Females in Managerial Position

•	Percent of Females in Ownership Position


We have decided that these variables will show how the health of the population is potentially intertwined with its education and legislative moves to egalitarianism between the sexes.
