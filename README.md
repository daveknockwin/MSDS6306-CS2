## World Development Indicators

### Introduction

Our world is becoming less poor and more healthy with every year. This is encouraging news, but we must also study potential causes for and hinderences to this phenomenon. 

### Data

We found our data on on the world bank website at: https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.DYN.CBRT.IN. The reason we chose this data is because it included Education, Occupation and Gender. In the csv file titled “API_17_DS2_en_csv_v2_10226244.csv”, found in our data directory, we have data collected in all countries of the world between 1960 and 2016. There are 162 indicator variables for which data was collected, but data was not available for every indicator variable. 

For the purposes of our model, we will be looking at the following variables more closely: 

•	Survival to age 65, male (% of cohort)

•	Survival to age 65, female (% of cohort)

•	Children in employment, male (% of male children ages 7-14)

•	Children in employment, female (% of female children ages 7-14)

•	Employment to population ratio, 15+, male (%) (modeled ILO estimate)

•	Employment to population ratio, 15+, female (%) (modeled ILO estimate)

•	Maternal mortality ratio (national estimate, per 100,000 live births)

•	Maternal mortality ratio (modeled estimate, per 100,000 live births)

•	Prevalence of underweight, weight for age, male (% of children under 5)

•	Prevalence of underweight, weight for age, female (% of children under 5)

•	Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, male (% of 24 hour day)

•	Proportion of time spent on unpaid domestic and care work, female (% of 24 hour day)

•	Legislation exists on domestic violence (1=yes; 0=no)

•	Law prohibits or invalidates child or early marriage (1=yes; 0=no)

•	Women making their own informed decisions regarding sexual relations, contraceptive use and reproductive health care  (% of women age 15-49)

•	School enrollment, tertiary, male (% gross)

•	School enrollment, tertiary, female (% gross)

•	Educational attainment, at least Bachelor's or equivalent, population 25+, male (%) (cumulative)

•	Educational attainment, at least Bachelor's or equivalent, population 25+, female (%) (cumulative)

•	Literacy rate, youth male (% of males ages 15-24)

•	Literacy rate, youth (ages 15-24), gender parity index (GPI)

•	Literacy rate, youth female (% of females ages 15-24)

We have decided that these variables will show how the health of the population is potentially intertwined with its education and legislative moves to egalitarianism between the sexes.
